# Windows ASR Controller
*A graphical utility for managing Microsoft Defender Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules.*

Windows ASR Controller is a lightweight GUI tool that allows personal users, students, and cybersecurity educators to easily configure Microsoft Defender's **Attack Surface Reduction** rules without using PowerShell manually.

The [repository](https://github.com/kaledaljebur/Windows-ASR-Controller) contains **three versions** of the tool:

- **🟦 EXE Version:** Standalone Windows executable (no Python required)  
- **🐍 Python Version:** Installable via PyPI (`windows-asr-controller`)  
- **📜 PS1 Version:** Original PowerShell ASR Manager script  

---

## 🚀 Features
- View all ASR rules and their current modes  
- Enable, disable, audit, or warn any ASR rule  
- Apply actions to all rules or selected rules  
- Import and export rule configurations in JSON format  
- GUI and PowerShell versions  
- Uses official Microsoft Defender cmdlets under the hood  
- Suitable for unmanaged / personal Windows devices  
- No internet access required once installed  

---
## 📦 Installation (PyPI Version)

Install using pip:

```bash
py -m pip install windows-asr-controller
```

Run the application in admin CMD:

```bash
py -m windows-asr-controller
```

No additional libraries are required — only Python's standard library.

---

## 🖥️ Windows EXE Version (Standalone)

A prebuilt executable is included in the repository:

[windows_asr_controller.exe](https://github.com/kaledaljebur/Windows-ASR-Controller/tree/main/dist/)


Just double-click to launch.  
Windows will display a **UAC prompt** because ASR configuration requires administrator privileges.

---

## 📜 PowerShell Version (PS1)

The repository also includes the PowerShell edition:


[Windows-ASR-Controller.ps1](https://github.com/kaledaljebur/Windows-ASR-Controller)


This script provides a full menu interface for managing ASR rules.

---

## 🛡️ Requirements
- Windows 10 or Windows 11  
- Administrator privileges  
- **Microsoft Defender Antivirus must be enabled**  
  - ASR rules do *not* work if Defender is disabled or replaced  
- Python 3.8+ (for the PyPI version)

---

## ❗ Important Notes
- This tool does not modify Group Policy or Intune settings.  
- It is designed for **local, non-domain-joined** Windows machines.  
- If Defender is disabled, ASR rules will not take effect.
